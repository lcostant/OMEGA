# RGB noiseless images of TNG50 high-redshift galaxies

Noiseless synthetic images of high-redshift galaxies in TNG50 can be download at LINK (XX TB of disk space).

The current data release (v1.0) provides images (.fits) at NIRCam (0.031 and 0.063 arcsec px$^{-1}$ for short and long wavelengths) and MIRI (0.110 arcsec px$^{-1}$) angular resolution. Each galaxy can be seen under 20 configurations (5 inclinations and 4 azimuths).

Furthermore, it provides a resolved version of TNG50 galaxies at 0.010 arcsec px$^{-1}$ (in the ./TNG50 directory). This version can be used to create synthetic RBG images of the galaxy using the script in this directory.

Here, an example showing the galaxy ID0 (i0_a0) is provided.
