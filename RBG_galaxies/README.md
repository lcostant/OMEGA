## RGB images of TNG50 galaxies

The current data release (TNG50 v1.0) provides images at NIRCam (0.031 and 0.063 arcsec/px for short and long wavelengths) and MIRI (0.110 arcsec/px) angular resolution. Each galaxy can be seen under 20 configurations (5 inclinations and 4 azimuths).

Furthermore, this data release provides a resolved version of TNG50 galaxies at 0.010 arcsec/px. This last version can be used to create synthetic RBG images of the galaxy (see example) using the python script in this directory.

The full set of synthetic images of high-redshift galaxies in TNG50 can be download at LINK (XX TB of disk space). One example galaxy is also provided in the main repository and can be used along the script in this directory, with some minor changes in the code. A detailed description of the dataset can be found in Costantin+2022, to which citation is requested if you use these products.
