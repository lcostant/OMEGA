## Project description

The project provides noiseless mock images from Illustris TNG50 cosmological simulations ([Pillepich et al. 2019](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:1902.05553), [Dylan er al 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.3234N/abstract)) in all JWST NIRCam and MIRI filters, created applying radiative transfer calculations using SKIRT v9 ([Camps et al 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26C....3100381C/abstract)).

<<<<<<< HEAD
The noiseless mock images can be processed with MIRAGE and MIRISIM simulators for mimicking NIRCam and MIRI observation, respectively. In particular, NIRCam observations using the observing strategy of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey ([CEERS](https://ceers.github.io)) are available.

The simulated images are reduced with the ([official pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst)), adapted for the case of interest.
