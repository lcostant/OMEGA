## Project description

The project provides noiseless mock images from Illustris TNG50 cosmological simulations ([Pillepich et al. 2019](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:1902.05553), [Dylan er al 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.3234N/abstract)) in all JWST NIRCam and MIRI filters, created applying radiative transfer calculations using SKIRT ([Camps et al 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26C....3100381C/abstract)).

The noiseless mock images are processed with MIRAGE and MIRISIM simulators for mimicking NIRCam and MIRI observation, respectively. In particular, the observing strategy of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey ([CEERS](https://ceers.github.io)) was reproduced.

The simulated images are reduced with the standard pipeline, adapted for the case of interest.
