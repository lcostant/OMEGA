### OMEGA
---------

This is OMEGA (Observing the Morphological Evolution of GAlaxies), 
a project which aims at studying the morphological evolution of galaxies through time. 

The project provides noiseless mock images from Illustris TNG50 cosmological simulations
(REFERENCE) in all JWST NIRCam and MIRI filters, created applying radiative transfer calculations
using SKIRT (Camps et al 2020).

The noiseless mock images are processed with MIRAGE and MIRISIM simulators for
mimicking NIRCam and MIRI observation, respectively. In particular, the observing
strategy of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey (CEERS) was reproduced.

The simulated images are reduced with the standard pipeline, adapted for the case of interest.
