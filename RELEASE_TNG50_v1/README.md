# :Title           : NIRCam and MIRI synthetic images of high-redshift galaxies from the IllustrisTNG50
# 
# :Description     : This data release is composed of synthetic images of ∼25,000 galaxies from the IllustrisTNG50.
#                    Galaxies are selected to be more massive than 10^9 solar masses at redshift z=3, z=4, z=5, and z=6.
#                    Synthetic images were created with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, including the effects
#                    of dust attenuation and scattering. Galaxies are observed (imaging mode) with the NIRCam 
#                    and MIRI instruments mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope. In particular, each galaxy is
#                    observed under 20 configurations (5 inclinations and 4 azimuths) in all available filters.
#                    A detailed description of the release can be found in the reference paper (Costantin+2022, in prep.),
