# RGB synthetic images

## Massive galaxies at redshift 3<z<6 from IllustrisTNG50

This TNG50 data release (v1.0) provides a resolved version of TNG50 galaxies at angular resution of 0.010 arcsec/px. This version can be used to create synthetic RBG images of the galaxy (see example) using the python script in this directory.

The full set of synthetic images of high-redshift galaxies in TNG50 can be download at LINK (XX TB of disk space). One example galaxy is also provided in the main repository and can be used along the script in this directory, with some minor changes in the code. A detailed description of the dataset can be found in Costantin+2022, to which citation is requested if you use these products.
